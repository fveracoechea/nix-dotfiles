## Installation

1. Run:

```zsh
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:fveracoechea/dotfiles.git ~/.config
cd ~/config
make brew-install
```

2. Add the following at the top of your `.zshrc`:

```zsh
source ~/.config/zsh/oh-my-zsh.zsh
```

3. Then open `tmux` and press `prefix` + <kbd>I</kbd> (capital i, as in **I**nstall) to fetch the plugin.

4. I manage the various configuration files in this repo using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/). This allows me to set up symlinks for all of my dotfiles using a single command:

```.zsh
stow .
```

You're good to go!
